In the previous step, id_token and access_token were directly obtained on the front end. Next, developers can use **access_token** to exchange for user information on the front end. If the scope parameter is different when initiating authorization login, the returned information here will also be different. The fields in the returned information depend on the scope parameter. The fields comply with the [OIDC specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthorizationExamples). For the correspondence between user information fields and scopes, please refer to [User information corresponding to scope parameters](/concepts/oidc-common-questions.md#scope-User information corresponding to parameters).

For more field explanations, please refer to [ID Token complete field meaning](/concepts/id-token.md#id-token-complete field meaning).

Next, you can save user information, IdToken and AccessToken on the front end for subsequent use, access the resource server with AccessToken, request the server with IdToken, etc.
