<IntegrationDetailCard title="Create Programmatic Access Account">

After defining resources and operations, add a **programmatic access account** to the application. The **programmatic access account** is the **caller** of the current application API interface. The **programmatic access account** has a pair of **AK and SK**, which are used to give to outsourcers to call the "large screen display" application interface. We can give AK and SK with different permissions to different outsourcers, so that they have different permissions and can access different APIs.

Create two programmatic access accounts, fill in the AccessToken expiration time and remarks, and click OK.

If the programmatic access account is deleted, the caller will lose the ability to obtain user authorization.

### AccessToken expiration time

When you create a programmatic access account, you need to specify the AccessToken expiration time. GenAuth uses the RS256 signature algorithm to sign when issuing AccessToken to ensure that AccessToken cannot be tampered with.

> Token signature is part of JWT. For more information, please refer to [JWT Interpretation and Use](/advanced/authentication/jwt-token.md).

RS256 is an asymmetric signature algorithm. GenAuth holds the private key to sign the token, and the consumer of JWT uses the public key to verify the signature.
The RS256 signature algorithm has the following benefits:

1. Anyone can verify the signature using the application public key, and the signer must be GenAuth.

2. No risk of private key leakage. If you use HS256 but leak the application key, you need to refresh the key and redeploy all APIs.

For more information about signature issues, please refer to [Verify Token](../../advanced/verify-jwt-token.md).

We have just created two programming access accounts, which will need to be handed over to outsourcers in the future.
