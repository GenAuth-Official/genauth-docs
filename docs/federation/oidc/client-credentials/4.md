<IntegrationDetailCard title="Get AccessToken with permissions">

**OIDC Authorization Framework** provides many authorization modes. In this scenario, obtaining user growth information belongs to **M2M** (machine-to-machine) authorization. Without user participation, the caller uses his own identity to access the API interface of the resource server. Here, the **OIDC ClientCredentials mode** is required.

Through the OIDC ClientCredentials authorization mode, the caller needs to provide GenAuth with his ClientCredentials (that is, the Key and Secret of the **programmatic access account**) and the permission scope to be requested (that is, the **resource identifier**) to directly obtain an AccessToken with the API permission.

1. The caller sends the Key and Secret of the **programmatic access account** and the **permission project scope** to be requested to GenAuth.
2. GenAuth verifies the **programmatic access account** Key and Secret, and checks the scope permission items according to the permission rules configured by the administrator, and issues an AccessToken with **access resource permissions**. The rejected scope **will not** appear in the AccessToken.
3. The caller carries the AccessToken to access the resource server.

In order to access the protected API interface, the caller must first **obtain an AccessToken with permissions**.

We only authorize the reading permission of the announcement information to outsourcing company A. If outsourcing company A carries other scopes when requesting authorization, for example: `announce:read announce:update revenue:read customer user-growth:read`. GenAuth will reject all permissions except `announce:read`. The following is the return result when outsourcing company A requests authorization. The rejected permissions are in `rejected_scope`.

AccessToken contains the permission scope:

Let's look at the authorization of outsourcer B. If outsourcer B wants to request the following scopes: `user-growth:2020:read` `user-growth:2019:*` `user-growth:2019:read` `revenue:create` `revenue:*:read` `customer:read`

The return result of GenAuth is as follows:

It should be noted that the administrator only authorized all permissions for the 2019 user growth data to outsourcer B, so when requesting the 2020 user growth data scope is denied.

<IntegrationDetailCard title="Scope permission item specification">

GenAuth's scope permission items are separated by **spaces**, and the format of each item is `resource identifier: resource operation`.

The following are all scope formats supported by GenAuth:

`book:1:read` means the read permission for the book resource numbered 1

`book:*:read` means the read permission for all book resources

`book:read` means the read permission for all book resources

`book:*:*` means all operation permissions for all book resources

`book` means all operation permissions for all book resources

`*:*:*` means all operation permissions for all resources

`*:*` means all operation permissions for all resources

`*` means all operation permissions for all resources

</IntegrationDetailCard>

<IntegrationDetailCard title="Add API Authentication Interceptor">

After GenAuth defines the API, you need to add an API authentication interceptor to your actual business API interface. For protected resources, only visitors with a valid AccessToken and the required permissions are allowed to access.
The code example is as follows:

```javascript
var express = require("express");
var app = express();
var jwt = require("express-jwt");
var jwks = require("jwks-rsa");
var port = process.env.PORT || 8080;
var jwtCheck = jwt({
  secret: jwks.expressJwtSecret({
    cache: true,
    rateLimit: true,
    jwksRequestsPerMinute: 5,
    jwksUri: "https://{app domain name}.genauth.ai/oidc/.well-known/jwks.json",
  }),
  audience: "{programming access account ID}",
  issuer: "https://{app domain name}.genauth.ai/oidc",
  algorithms: ["RS256"],
});
// Check the legitimacy of AccessToken
app.use(jwtCheck);

app.post("/article", function (req, res) {
  // Check if AccessToken has the required permissions
  if (!req.user.scope.split(" ").incldues("write:article")) {
    return res.status(401).json({ code: 401, message: "Unauthorized" });
  }
  res.send("Secured Resource");
});

app.listen(port);
```
