In the previous step, the code was used to exchange for a token. Next, developers can use **access_token** to exchange for user information. If the scope parameter is different when initiating authorization login, the returned information here will also be different. The fields in the returned information depend on the scope parameter. The fields comply with the [OIDC specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthorizationExamples). For the correspondence between the user information field and the scope, please refer to [User information corresponding to the scope parameter](/concepts/oidc-common-questions.md#scope-User information corresponding to the parameter).

<StackSelector snippet="get-user-info" selectLabel="Select language" :order="['javascript', 'curl']"/>

For more field explanations, please refer to [ID Token complete field meaning](/concepts/id-token.md#id-token-complete field meaning).

Next, you can save the user's information to your database, redirect to other front-end pages, use AccessToken to call other APIs of the resource party, etc.
