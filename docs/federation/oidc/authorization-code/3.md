In the previous step, the code was used to exchange for a token. Next, the developer should use the **access_token** to exchange for user information on their **backend server**. If the scope parameter is different when initiating the authorization login, the returned information here will also be different. The fields in the returned information depend on the scope parameter. The fields comply with the [OIDC specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthorizationExamples). For the correspondence between the user information field and the scope, please refer to [User information corresponding to the scope parameter](/concepts/oidc-common-questions.md#scope-User information corresponding to the parameter).

<StackSelector snippet="get-user-info" selectLabel="Select language" :order="['javascript', 'curl']"/>

For more field explanations, please refer to [ID Token complete field meaning](/concepts/id-token.md#id-token-complete field meaning).

Next, you can save the user's information to your database, establish your own logged-in session with the user, send the IdToken to the front-end, redirect to other front-end pages, use the AccessToken to call other APIs of the resource party, etc.
