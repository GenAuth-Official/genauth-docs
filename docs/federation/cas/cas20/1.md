<IntegrationDetailCard title="Initiate CAS 2.0 Authentication">

To initiate CAS 2.0 authentication, you need to redirect the user to the previously recorded "Login Endpoint" URL with the following query parameters:

- `service`: Required, needs to be consistent with the previously configured "Login Callback URL".

- `renew`: Optional, default value is false. If set to true, the authentication page will be forced to pop up when logging in, regardless of whether the user has logged in at {{$localeConfig.brandName}} before.

- `gateway`: Optional, default value is false. If set to true, if the user has not logged in at {{$localeConfig.brandName}} before, the authentication will fail directly and the authentication page will not pop up.

> The `renew` and `gateway` parameters cannot be set to true at the same time.

Request example:

```
https://<app domain name>.genauth.ai/cas-idp/<app ID>/login?service=<callback address>
```
