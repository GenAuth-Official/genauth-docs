Special note: After configuring the associated data type, in addition to the data object being configured, an associated type field will also be generated on the associated data object side, but it is not displayed by default. If the associated fields on both sides are displayed, <string>bidirectional data association</string> can be achieved. That is: A is associated with B, and when A updates the association, B will update it synchronously; when B updates the association, A will also update it synchronously.
