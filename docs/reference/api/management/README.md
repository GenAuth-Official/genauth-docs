# GenAuth Management API

The GenAuth Management API allows requests to be made with administrator privileges to manage user pool resources and perform administrative tasks. These include managing users, organizations, roles, applications, permissions, and user pool configurations. In general, any action that can be performed in the GenAuth console can also be executed through this API module.

Commonly used endpoints include:

- User Management: Modify user profiles, retrieve user lists, search for users, and view user logs.
- Organization Management: Perform CRUD operations on organizations and departments, as well as manage employee onboarding, transfers, and departures.
- Role Management: Create roles and assign permissions.
- Group Management: Create groups and add members.
- Custom Field Management: Define custom schemas for users, roles, and organizations.
- Resource and Permission Management: Create resources, grant permissions, and retrieve authorized entities for a resource.
- Application Management: Create applications and update application details.
- Sync Center Management: Automatically create and execute synchronization tasks.
- Audit Log Management: Retrieve user activity logs and administrator operation logs within the user pool.
- Billing and Usage Management: Check Monthly Active Users (MAU) statistics and subscription plan usage.
