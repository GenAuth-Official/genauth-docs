Using this method, the end user will be redirected to your online login page hosted by GenAuth through a browser `302` redirect for authentication. After the authentication is completed, it will call back to your application system, and depending on the authorization mode you choose (see below), it will carry credentials in the browser address bar, which you can use to obtain the user's `id_token`, `access_token` and `refresh_token`. As shown below:

> The GenAuth hosted login page is the simplest and most secure integration method. This is because the login process is maintained by GenAuth and kept secure by GenAuth. For most integrations, it is recommended to use the login process hosted by GenAuth. Your business system redirects the user to GenAuth, where the user authenticates and then redirects back to the application callback connection configured in the console. This design is considered a security best practice. In terms of custom configuration, the hosted mode provides a moderate degree of login registration form customization, which can be customized through console configuration and CSS.
