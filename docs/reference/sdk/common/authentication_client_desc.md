The user authentication module (AuthenticationClient) makes requests as an end user, providing all user self-service operations such as login, registration, logout, management of user information, and obtaining authorized resources. This module also provides SDKs for various identity protocols, such as [OpenID Connect](https://docs.authing.co/concepts/oidc/oidc-overview.html#openid-connect.html), [OAuth 2.0](https://docs.authing.co/concepts/oidc/oidc-overview.html#oauth-2-0), [SAML](https://docs.authing.co/concepts/saml/saml-overview.html) and [CAS](https://docs.authing.co/connections/cas).
