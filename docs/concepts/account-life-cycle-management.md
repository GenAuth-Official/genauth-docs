# Account Lifecycle Management

<LastUpdated/>

As a company grows, the number of internal applications and personnel will continue to increase. With the constant onboarding and resignation of employees, the frequent adjustment of the personnel organizational structure, the complex application account system within the enterprise, and the steep increase in the workload of administrators to manually operate accounts. At the same time, the lack of a unified account management control solution will also bring hidden dangers to the safety production of enterprises, and there are often security risk cases where employees leave but the application accounts are not closed.

Replacing manual account management with automated **Account Lifecycle Management (LCM)** is the key to liberating enterprise IT personnel from the tedious and complex identity information management work involved in flexible employment. At the same time, it can also improve the overall business security factor of the enterprise by timely closing personnel accounts and reducing the authorization error rate.

## Improve productivity and reduce costs

No need to press buttons, no need to wait. Automated access from creation to deletion. Use the resources you need to get your employees up and running quickly and free up time for the IT team to work on larger projects.

Fast and secure pre-configuration. Automated access management not only saves you time, it also saves you money. Faster provisioning means you’ll recoup software licenses and save costs. And don’t even get us started on the money you’ll save by not having accounts that are still active get hacked.

## Reduce complexity

Adopt automated processes and solve complexity. The enterprise has deployed a hub-and-spoke model that includes a centralized unified identity supply platform, with internal enterprise applications as endpoints of the spoke model, and each application endpoint is connected to the unified identity supply platform.
Each identity created in the unified identity supply platform and a suffix applied to each identity to ensure that identities between identities do not conflict with each other. This feature eliminates manual processes associated with internal personnel changes in the company. For example, if a new employee’s first and last name are the same as those of a current employee, the workflow will identify and resolve the situation so that each user has a unique email address and username.

## More secure and compliant

From the time an employee joins the company, all account allocation and revocation are guaranteed by automated processes, avoiding the security risk of employees being manually assigned to unauthorized accounts or accounts not being revoked after leaving the company, resulting in corporate information leakage. In addition, there are corresponding log records for each link in the life cycle operations such as account allocation and withdrawal to ensure the security and compliance of the company's production process.
