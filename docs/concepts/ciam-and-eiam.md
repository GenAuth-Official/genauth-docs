# CIAM and EIAM

<LastUpdated/>

## Let's first talk about what IAM, EIAM and CIAM are

IAM: Identity and Access Managetment, or simply identity management.

In fact, looking back over the past twenty years, when we discussed IAM, most people thought of internal products (Enterprise Identity & Access Management or EIAM) that provide unified identity authentication and permission management capabilities for internal employees, partners, temporary staff, etc. However, this is unimaginative. We cannot simply talk about and develop EIAM just because of the tradition of EIAM.

As the boundaries of software expand to all aspects of our lives, the demand for unified identity management is also expanding. With the enterprise as the core, from the inside out, enterprises have also begun to accommodate a large number of external customer identities, thus giving birth to customer identity management (Customer Identity & Access Management or CIAM) for Internet users. For example, the identity management of engineers and couriers within JD.com belongs to EIAM, while the identity management of sellers and buyers on the e-commerce platform belongs to CIAM.

## What is IDaaS today?

Since 2015, foreign service providers such as Accenture and AWS have taken the lead in treating CIAM as an independent and necessary product. Completely different from EIAM products that focus on internal efficiency, CIAM aims to assist enterprises in completing the overall information transformation, unify the identity of users in all external services, and provide end users with complete identity self-service in the user competition centered on experience, and provide users of different platforms with a unified and smooth use and registration experience, so as to improve user retention and stickiness, further create value, and gain an advantage in industry competition.

> "The unique requirements of customer identity management, especially the requirements for scale, performance, availability, and seamless use across platforms, make CIAM an independent market, completely different from EIAM for employee identity management. —— Forrester"

So, what is IDaaS today? It is not just about moving EIAM from 20 years ago to the cloud, but about moving EIAM & CIAM to the cloud, so that Chinese enterprises can move towards global digital transformation with perfect IDaaS.

## Why do Chinese enterprises start using EIAM & CIAM IDaaS?

Today, leading IDaaS service providers are committed to providing enterprises with ready-to-use, secure and scalable user management and authentication services. With IDaaS, the enterprise's IT R&D and operation and maintenance personnel can quickly manage the connection of any application, personnel or device. Whether it is a customer, member or partner, whether it is on the cloud, locally or on a mobile device, IDaaS service providers can help government and enterprise IT services become more secure, increase the speed of external core business launch, and improve the productivity of internal personnel and maintain compliance.
