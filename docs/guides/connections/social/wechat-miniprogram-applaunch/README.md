## Notes

## Step 1: Create a WeChat mobile application on WeChat Open Platform

Go to [WeChat Open Platform](https://open.weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/index?t=home/index&lang=zh_CN) to create a **WeChat mobile application**.

After the creation is complete, you need to record the **AppID** and **AppSecret** of the application, which will be used later.

## Step 2: Associate the mini program in WeChat Open Platform

Go to [WeChat Open Platform](https://open.weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/index?t=home/index&lang=zh_CN) **Admin Center->Mobile Application->Application Details->Associate Mini Program Information Page** to associate the mini program.

## Step 3: Create a WeChat mini program in WeChat Open Platform (optional)

By default, the default mini program provided by GenAuth will be used when the APP launches the mini program login.

If you belong to one of these two scenarios:

Please follow the WeChat public platform instructions to create a WeChat mini program. You need to record the application's **AppID** and **AppSecret**, which will be needed later.
