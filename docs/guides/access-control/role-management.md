# Role Management

<LastUpdated/>

A display list based on roles. You can view the basic information of the role and which permission space it belongs to. The roles of each permission space are isolated, and each role can only belong to one permission space. A permission space can have multiple roles.

Click on the role details page to view the basic information, permission management, and extended fields of each role.

Basic information: Authorize the role to the corresponding subject (user/organization).

Permission management: Which general resource authorizations are under the current role and which data resource policies are associated. Each policy can be understood as a data resource permission group.

The extended fields are synchronized with the extended fields under **Settings->Field Management->Role Field Management**, and some attributes are customized to describe the role.
