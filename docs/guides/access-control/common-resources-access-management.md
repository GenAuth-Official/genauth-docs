# General resource permissions

<LastUpdated/>

The old version resource types including data, API, menu, and button are uniformly defined as general resources in the new version permission management. In the new version, there is no specific distinction between resource types.
The old version of data resources is just a type of identification, and the new version of data resources has different data structures.

## General resources

Basic information: What operations are currently available for general resources.
Authorization rules: Which subjects are currently authorized to general resources. Click the **Edit** button in the subject row to view the subject type and edit the authorization rules.
