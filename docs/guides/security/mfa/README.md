Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) is a very simple security practice that can add an extra layer of protection beyond the username and password. After enabling MFA, when a user logs in, in addition to providing a username and password (the first authentication), a second authentication is required. Multi-factor authentication combined will provide higher security protection for your account and resources. You can learn about [What is Multi-factor Authentication](/concepts/mfa.md) here.

You can learn the following MFA authentication information in this section:

- [MFA based on SMS verification code](./sms.md)
- [MFA based on email verification code](./email-code.md)
- [MFA based on one-time password with timestamp algorithm](./totp.md)
- [MFA based on face recognition](./face-recognition.md)
- [Access MFA through SDK](./mfa-sdk.md)
- [MFA policy configuration](./policy-based-mfa-configuration.md)
