# Manage User Directory

<LastUpdated/>

You can think of the {{$localeConfig.brandName}} user directory as a directory that stores all your user information. You can search for users and view user information in the user directory; and manage user directory configurations, such as prohibiting registration and configuring whitelists; the schema of this user directory is extensible, and you can add custom user fields; at the same time, you can use multiple standard protocols (such as SAML, LDAP, OIDC, OAuth2.0) as an identity provider to provide external identity authentication capabilities.

> If you want to know how to manage the user information of a single user, please see [Manage User Accounts](../user/README.md).

The following content is in no particular order. You can choose the content you are interested in to read:

- [Learn how to search for users](./search.md);
