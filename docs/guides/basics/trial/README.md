# GenAuth Trial Period Benefits Strategy

<LastUpdated/>

## Background

{{$localeConfig.brandName}} adheres to the developer-friendly concept and is willing to open the functions that meet the basic rights of developers to all developers for free forever. However, this free version will not only limit the use of benefits (such as the number of active users allowed and the number of self-built applications), but also some advanced functions will not be available (such as enterprise identity connection, single sign-on, application panel, etc.). In order to allow developers to have a more comprehensive understanding of {{$localeConfig.brandName}} capabilities, fully experience {{$localeConfig.brandName}} functions, and choose the benefits that match their needs, {{$localeConfig.brandName}} proposed the concept of "trial period", providing all functions to developers who open the trial period within a limited time to achieve a comprehensive experience.

## Trial Period Features

The trial period has the following characteristics:

- Limited to 30 days.

- Provide a trial period for the three scenario user pools of ToB, ToC, and ToE. Each scenario can only be experienced once, and different scenarios provide different benefits and usage.

- Open all benefits under the current user pool of {{$localeConfig.brandName}} and limit the usage of benefits.

- Provide a countdown reminder for the trial period.
