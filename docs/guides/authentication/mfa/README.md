Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a very simple security practice that can add an extra layer of protection beyond the username and password. After enabling MFA, when users log in, in addition to providing a username and password (the first authentication), they also need to perform a second authentication. Multi-factor authentication combined will provide higher security protection for your account and resources. You can learn about [What is multi-factor authentication](/concepts/mfa.md) here.

- [MFA based on face recognition](/guides/security/mfa/face-recognition.md)
