Path: **Apps->Self-built Apps->App Details->Branding**

::: hint-info
* The **Branding** tab in the application is closed by default. At this time, the branding-related configuration of the application will be controlled by the configuration in the global login box. To configure the login box of a single application separately, you can turn on the **Customize this application's login box** switch in **Advanced Configuration->Custom Configuration**.
* When the **Customize this application's login box** switch is turned on, the login box style of the current application will inherit the configuration in the current global branding (**Branding->Global Login Box**). After turning it on, the administrator's login box style configuration for this self-built application will be independent of the configuration in the global branding.
:::

Administrators can customize the {{$localeConfig.brandName}} ​hosted login box UI and login registration information completion function in the **Branding** tab of the self-built application in the user pool.

**Self-built application->Branding** configuration and **Branding->Global login box** configuration are the same. For more information, see [Global login box branding configuration](/guides/customize/global-guard/README.md).
