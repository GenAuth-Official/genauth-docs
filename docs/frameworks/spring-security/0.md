<IntegrationDetailCard title="Spring Security Brief">

This article takes Spring Security 5, which is used to provide authentication and access control in the Spring ecosystem, as an example to introduce in detail how Spring Security 5 can be connected to GenAuth OIDC.

Spring Security is a security framework that provides a secure access control solution. It provides a set of beans that can be configured in the Spring application context, making full use of Spring IoC, DI (Inversion of Control, DI: Dependency Injection) and AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) functions to provide declarative security access control functions for application systems, enhance the security of enterprise systems, and reduce the burden of writing a lot of repetitive code.

The main functions of Spring Security include:

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Attack protection

Taking the OIDC service provided by GenAuth as an example, the following will introduce in detail how to use Spring Security 5 to integrate GenAuth OIDC single sign-on:

After creating the project, run the project in IDEA.

After the project is running, use the browser to access [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and it will automatically jump to the `/login` route. You can see a basic login form on the page, indicating that the project has been successfully initialized.
