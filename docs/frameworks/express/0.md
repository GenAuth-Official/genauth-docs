<IntegrationDetailCard title="Express Brief">

This article takes the Express framework based on the Node.js platform as an example, and integrates the Node.js identity authentication middleware Passport.js to introduce in detail how to integrate GenAuth OIDC single sign-on with Express.

OIDC protocol: OIDC (OpenID Connect) is a standard identity authentication protocol based on the OAuth2 protocol. OIDC uses the OAuth2 authorization server to provide user identity authentication for third-party clients, and passes the corresponding identity authentication information to the client, and can be applied to various types of clients.

Passport: Passport is an authentication middleware for Node.js, which is particularly flexible and modular. It can be easily implanted into any Express-based Web application. It supports username and password, Facebook and Twitter authentication.
