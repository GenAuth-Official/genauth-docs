# Integrate OIDC into Your Application

<LastUpdated/>

If your application already has OIDC capabilities but needs testing, you can skip this section. The [next chapter](/apn/test-oidc/) will provide testing methods for your application.

## Where to Find the Official OpenID Connect Integration Documentation

If you have a basic understanding of OIDC after reading the previous introduction and want your application to have OIDC capabilities, you can first visit the official website [OpenID Connect | OpenID](https://openid.net/connect/) to learn more.

## Can't Find OpenID Connect Integration Documentation?
