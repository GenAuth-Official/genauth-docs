Select an application and click to experience:

You can see that there is an additional button `Login with xxx` at the bottom of the form. This is the OIDC connection you just configured:

![](https://cdn.genauth.ai/blog/20201009181119.png)

Click this button and the browser will pop up a new window to the login page of the other party's OIDC IdP. Since we are using GenAuth's OIDC identity source here, we pop up a GenAuth login form:

![](https://cdn.genauth.ai/blog/20201009181857.png)

Log in using any login method supported by the OIDC IdP (here we use the account `test@genauth.ai`):

The browser window will then be closed and return to the GenAuth login form. At the same time, you can see that the user has been synchronized to the GenAuth user pool:

## Test this connection using the API interface

If you want to use your own login page to complete the OIDC identity source connection, you can do it manually by calling the API:

### POST `start-interaction`

<ApiMethodSpec method="post" host="https://core.genauth.ai" path="/api/connections/oidc/start-interaction">

<template slot="description">

When the user pool jumps back to the GenAuth server from the third-party OIDC IdP, GenAuth will determine the target user pool through the `state` in the callback parameter, so you need to call this interface first to associate the state with the user pool.

</template>
<template slot="bodyParams">
<ApiMethodParam name="state" type="string" description="Random string, required as the state for subsequent OIDC requests" required/>
<ApiMethodParam name="userPoolId" type="string" description="User pool ID" required/>
<ApiMethodParam name="returnTo" type="string" description="Callback link" required/>
</template>
<template slot="response">
<ApiMethodResponse httpCode="200">

```js
{
code: 200,
message: "ok"
}
```

</ApiMethodResponse>
</template>
</ApiMethodSpec>

### Initiate a login request to the OIDC IdP

::: hint-info
This step is to call the interface of the third-party OIDC IdP. Different OIDC IdP calling methods may vary. Here is Take GenAuth's OIDC IdP as an example. **One thing to note is that the state when initiating a login request needs to be consistent with the state of the first step. **
:::

<ApiMethodSpec method="get" host="https://<your application domain name>.genauth.ai" path="/oidc/auth" summary="Concatenate a link and let the end user access it in the browser to initiate an OIDC authorization login request." description="To initiate authorization, you need to concatenate a URL for authorization and let the end user access it in the browser. The specific parameters are as follows:">
<template slot="queryParams">
<ApiMethodParam name="client_id" type="string" description="Application ID" required/>
<ApiMethodParam name="redirect_uri" type="string" description="Random string, required as the state of subsequent OIDC requests" required>

Callback link. After the user successfully authenticates the OP, the OP will send the authorization code to this address in the form of a URL query. This value **must** appear in the **callback address** configured in the console, otherwise the OP will not allow callbacks to this address.

</ApiMethodParam>
<ApiMethodParam name="scope" type="string" required>

Required permissions, must include **openid**. If **get phone number** and **email** are required, phone email must be included; if refresh_token is required, offline_access must be included. Multiple scopes should be separated by **spaces**. **id_token** The decoded content will contain fields related to the user information corresponding to these scopes.

</ApiMethodParam>
<ApiMethodParam name="response_type" type="string" required>

The return type can be code, id_token, id_token token, code id_token, code token, code id_token token. After successful login, specify what information OP will return. If code is included, OP will return the authorization code. If id_token is included, OP will return the user's id_token. If token is included, OP will return the user's access_token.

</ApiMethodParam>
<ApiMethodParam name="prompt" type="string">

It can be none, login, consent or select_account, specifying the interaction method between OP and End-User. **If refresh_token is required**, **must be consent**.

</ApiMethodParam>
<ApiMethodParam name="state" type="string" required>

A random string used to prevent CSRF attacks. If the state value in the response is different from the state value set before sending the request, it means that it is under attack. **The state here needs to be consistent with the state in the first step. **

</ApiMethodParam>

<ApiMethodParam name="nonce" type="string" description="A random string used to prevent Replay attacks."/>

</template>

</ApiMethodSpec>

### Receive user information

After the user agrees to the authorization in the previous step, it will jump to the GenAuth server first. Then GenAuth will carry the user information to the `returnTo` parameter passed by the developer in the first step interface, and attach the following Get request parameters:

| Parameter | Description                                                       |
| :-------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| code      | Error or success code, 200 for success, non-200 for failure       |
| message   | Success or error message                                          |
| data      | userInfo, if code is not 200, this parameter will not be returned |

::: hint-warning
Some browsers and Web Servers may display 404 when the URL is too long, such as ASP.NET, you need to modify the configuration at this time. For details, please refer to [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28681366/in-asp-net-mvc-would-a-querystring-too-long-result-in-404-file-not-found-error/28681600).
:::

Here is the code to get user data from URL parameters using JavaScript:

```js
// Get URL parameters
function getQueryString(name) {
  var reg = new RegExp("(^|&)" + name + "=([^&]*)(&|$)", "i");
  var r = window.location.search.substr(1).match(reg);
  if (r != null) {
    return unescape(r[2]);
  }
  return null;
}

// Convert Code to Int type for easy judgment
const code = parseInt(getQueryString("code"));

if (code !== 200) {
  // Error
  const errorMsg = getQueryString("message");
  // Display errorMsg to the user or perform other business ...
} else {
  const userInfo = getQueryString("data");

  // Store token in localStorage
  // It is recommended to attach the token in subsequent requests and have the backend verify the legitimacy of the token
  localStorage.setItem("token", userInfo.token);
}
```
