<IntegrationDetailCard title="Create an OIDC Client in an OIDC Identity Provider">

The process of creating an OIDC Client may vary for different OIDC Identity Providers. You need to refer to the documentation of your OIDC Identity Provider to create an OIDC Client.

You need to configure the callback link of the OIDC Client in the appropriate place. The callback link specified when the OIDC client initiates a login request needs to match the callback link configured at the OIDC Identity Provider, otherwise an error will be reported.

The OIDC callback link of {{$localeConfig.brandName}} is: `https://core.genauth.ai/connection/oidc/callback`.
