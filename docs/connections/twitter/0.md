Please follow the instructions in the [Twitter documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/getting-started) to create an application in the [Twitter Developer Center](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/). You need to record the application's **API Key** and **API Secret Key**, which will be needed later.

When creating an application, you need to fill in the callback address allowed by the application. Please use the following settings:

```
https://core.genauth.ai/connection/social/{ unique identifier }/{YOUR_USERPOOL_ID}/callback
```

> Replace { unique identifier } with the unique identifier filled in the identity source you are creating in GenAuth, and replace {YOUR_USERPOOL_ID} with your [user pool ID](/guides/faqs/get-userpool-id-and-secret.md)
