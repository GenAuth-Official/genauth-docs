2. Among all the social identity source icons, find and enter **QQ** Social Login.
3. In the configuration form, fill in the following configuration according to the instructions:

- Client ID: QQ application ID;

- Client Secret: QQ application key;

- Redirect: If you choose to manually call the social login interface, you need to fill in this field. GenAuth will send the user information to this address in plain text in the form of URL Query, and you need to parse it manually. For details on how to access, please refer to step 4.
- Scopes (optional): By default, {{$localeConfig.brandName}} will only request authorization for basic user information (such as avatar, nickname, etc.) from users. If you need more advanced permissions, you can check the corresponding options. For detailed instructions, please see [Configure login authorization Scopes](social-login-scopes.md#qq).

4. After the configuration is completed, click the "Create" button to complete the creation.
