<IntegrationDetailCard title="Create an application in Azure Active Directory">

In order for users to log in to your application through Azure AD accounts, you need to register your application in the Microsoft Azure portal first.

> Detailed official documentation: [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)

During the application registration process, please pay attention to the following two configurations:

- `Supported account types`: Supported account types, select the appropriate type according to your actual situation. If you want accounts from other organizations to be able to use your application, please select `Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant`. If you only want members of your own organization to use your application, please select `Single tenant`.

If you select `Single tenant`, when users from other organizations try to log in with Azure AD, an error similar to the following will be prompted:

- `Redirect URI`: Please fill in `https://core.genauth.ai/connections/azure-ad/callback`

After creation, Azure will automatically create an application ID (Client ID) for this application. You can see it in the **Overview** menu. **You will need it later, so please record it first**.
