<IntegrationDetailCard title="Create a SAML Identity Provider in the SAML Identity Service Provider">

You need to access your SAML Identity Provider and obtain the following information (which will be used when configuring the SAML Identity Provider in {{$localeConfig.brandName}} in the next step). Please also confirm that your SAML Identity Provider supports SAML login requests initiated by the Service Provider (Service Provider-initiated).

> If you just want to test, you can use the open source [SAML Identity Provider](https://github.com/mcguinness/saml-idp) on GitHub.

Sometimes `Issuer`, `Single Sign-On URL`, `Signature Certificate` can only be obtained after uploading the Metadata of the Service Provider (such as ACS URL, Audience URI), and the ACS URL and Audience URI can only be obtained after {{$localeConfig.brandName}} is created. If your SAML Identity Provider belongs to this scenario, please read the next section first.

- IdP Issuer URI — The Issuer URI of the Identity Provider. This value is usually the `entityID` of the SAML Identity Provider `EntityDescriptor`.
- IdP Single Sign-On URL — The endpoint where the SAML Identity Provider receives SAML login requests initiated by {{$localeConfig.brandName}}.
- IdP Signature Certificate — The public key in PEM or DER format used by the SAML Identity Provider to verify the SAML Message.
