<IntegrationDetailCard title="Start Development Access">

For this part, please follow the [WeChat official document](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/doc/oplatform/Mobile_App/Access_Guide/iOS.html) to access WechatOpenSDK. If you encounter any problems, here is a Swift Demo App for developers to refer to: [https://github.com/authing/AuthingIOSDemo](https://github.com/authing/AuthingIOSDemo) .

### Initiate a login request

After successfully accessing the SDK, you should be able to successfully open WeChat to obtain user authorization and obtain the authorization code:

Here is an example of the WeChat login request code (Swift):

```swift
func loginByWechat() {
let req = SendAuthReq()
req.scope = "snsapi_userinfo" //Get user information
req.state = "123" //Random value is fine, here is the timestamp
WXApi.send(req)
}
```

You can get the authorization code in the onResp method of AppDelegate or SceneDelegate, as shown below:

### Receive WeChat callback data to get code

Here is a sample code (Swift language):

```swift
func onResp(_ resp: BaseResp) {

debugPrint(resp)

// WeChat login request information
if resp.isKind(of: SendAuthResp.self) {
if resp.errCode == 0 && resp.type == 0{
let response = resp as! SendAuthResp

// WeChat authorization_code
let code = response.code
debugPrint("code: " ,code)
}
}
}
```

### Exchange for user information

After the user agrees to receive `code`, you can call the `loginByWeChatCode` method of [Swift SDK](/reference/sdk-for-swift.md) to obtain user information:

```swift
func loginByWeChatCode() {
//Login with the authentication code returned by WeChat SDK
let code = "code"
// Normal
self.client?.loginByWeChatCode(code: code, completion: { status in
print(status)
})
}
```
