<IntegrationDetailCard title="Create an app on LinkedIn">

Please follow the instructions in the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/consumer/integrations/self-serve/sign-in-with-linkedin#getting-started) to create an app. You need to record the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** of the app, which will be used later. You can refer to the following process.

On [LinkedIn Developers](https://developer.linkedin.com/), click Create app to start creating your app.

After creation, check the app information under Settings, Auth, Products, etc., and set the callback address by editing Authorized redirect URLs for your app. The callback address is set to: `https://core.genauth.ai/connection/social/{ unique identifier }/{YOUR_USERPOOL_ID}/callback`.

As shown in the figure below, under the Products tab of this page, you will see all the products available for this app. Click the Select button to the right of Sign In with LinkedIn to select this feature and follow the subsequent prompts to complete the operation. Usually, LinkedIn will approve your app to use the Sign In with LinkedIn feature after a few minutes.

Please use the following settings for the callback address:

```
https://core.genauth.ai/connection/social/{ unique identifier }/{YOUR_USERPOOL_ID}/callback
```

> Replace { unique identifier } with the unique identifier filled in the identity source you are creating in GenAuth, and replace {YOUR_USERPOOL_ID} with your [user pool ID](/guides/faqs/get-userpool-id-and-secret.md)
