Fill in your server export here IP address:

Due to the limitation of the DingTalk platform, the same IP can only be used by one enterprise, so you need to deploy a proxy with https forwarding capability on the server corresponding to the **server egress IP**, and {{$localeConfig.brandName}} will communicate with the DingTalk server through this proxy. You can use open source proxy solutions such as [goproxy](https://github.com/snail007/goproxy/blob/master/README_ZH.md) or purchase an anonymous proxy IP. If you don't know how to deploy, please see:
