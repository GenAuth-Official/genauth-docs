<IntegrationDetailCard :title="`Fill in the application configuration in ${$localeConfig.brandName}`">

You need to add the configuration of the application you created in the previous step in {{$localeConfig.brandName}}:

1. In the [{{$localeConfig.brandName}} console](https://console.genauth.ai), go to the "Social Identity Source" configuration page and click "Create Social Identity Source" to start selecting and creating.

3. Select **PC WeChat login** as the login method. In the configuration form, fill in the following configurations as instructed:

- `Unique ID`: Please enter a custom unique ID to represent the current identity source connection;

- `Display Name`: Please enter the display name, which will be displayed on the button of the terminal user's login interface;

- `App ID`: WeChat application ID;

- `App Secret`: WeChat application key;

- `Callback URL`: If you want to jump directly to the social identity source for authentication without any GenAuth page in the middle, you can configure this parameter as the business callback address after successful authentication. GenAuth will send the user's ID Token to this URL. For example, if your website domain name is https://example.com, and the url for processing the {{$localeConfig.brandName}} callback request is /auth/callback, then you should fill in `https://example.com/auth/callback`. **This parameter has nothing to do with the callback link in the application configuration**. If you configure the callback link separately in the application, you can fill in `#` in the address here.
