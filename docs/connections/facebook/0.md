During the application creation process, you need to configure the allowed callback address, please use the following settings:

```
https://core.genauth.ai/connection/social/{ unique identifier }/{YOUR_USERPOOL_ID}/callback
```

> Replace { unique identifier } with the unique identifier filled in the identity source you are creating in GenAuth, and replace {YOUR_USERPOOL_ID} with your [user pool ID](/guides/faqs/get-userpool-id-and-secret.md)
