<IntegrationDetailCard title="Create an App in Slack API">

Please follow the [Slack API documentation](https://api.slack.com/authentication/sign-in-with-slack#implementation) to create an app. You need to record the app's **App ID**, **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Signing Secret**, which will be needed later. You can refer to the following process.

First, through [Slack API: Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps), click Create New App to create an app.

If you have never used Slack before, you may need to create a Workspace first: click Create Another Workplace and complete the creation.

Once you have a Workspace, return to [Slack API: Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and click Create New App to continue creating the app. If prompted to select a creation method, select From scratch. Enter the App Name and select the Workspace, then click Create App to complete the creation.

Once the creation is complete, you will see the Basic Information about the app. Scroll down to App Credentials, where you will see the **App ID**, **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and **Signing Secret**, which you may need later.

Finally, click OAuth & Permissions in the sidebar, find the Redirect URLs setting area on the page, click Add New Redirect URL to add the following callback address: `https://core.genauth.ai/connection/social/{ YOUR_IDENTITYSOURCE_ID}/<GEN_AUTH_USERPOOL_ID>/callback`. After adding, click Save URLs to save the settings.

When creating an application, you need to configure the allowed callback addresses. Please use the following settings:

```
https://core.genauth.ai/connection/social/{ YOUR_IDENTITYSOURCE_ID }/{GEN_AUTH_USERPOOL_ID}/callback
```

> Replace { YOUR_IDENTITYSOURCE_ID } with the unique identifier of the identity source you are creating in GenAuth, and replace {GEN_AUTH_USERPOOL_ID} with your [User Pool ID](/guides/faqs/get-userpool-id-and-secret.md)
