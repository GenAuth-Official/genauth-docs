3. In the configuration form, fill in the following configurations as instructed:

- `Unique ID`: Please enter a custom unique ID to represent the current identity source connection;

- `Display Name`: Please enter the display name, which will be displayed on the button of the terminal user's login interface;

- `Mini Program Logo`: The uploaded Logo will be used as the Logo in the center of the Mini Program QR code;

- `Redirect`: This link is generally filled with your business address. If this link is configured, after the user completes the login, the browser will jump to this page with the user information;

- `Whether to enable private deployment`: If you want to use your own WeChat or customize the Mini Login Mini Program page style, you can contact us to obtain the source code of the Mini Login Mini Program. If this option is enabled, you must deploy your own mini-login applet and fill in the WeChat applet's AppID and AppSecret;
- `AppID`: AppID of the applet, filled in by users who choose to privatize the applet;
- `AppSecret`: AppSecret of the applet, filled in by users who choose to privatize the applet;
- `User account matching rule`: You can get the user's mobile phone number by scanning the QR code using the applet. If you want the user to automatically match an existing user based on the mobile phone number when logging in, you can turn on this switch, otherwise GenAuth will create a new account.
