:::hint-info
After configuring the event subscription, the operations in the Lark organization (such as the addition, deletion, modification, and query of departments, and the addition, deletion, modification, and query of users) will be synchronized to the GenAuth organization in real time. If you do not need this function, you can skip it.

If you have high security requirements for message content, you can encrypt messages by agreeing on a key with Feishu Open Platform; Feishu Open Platform will use this key to symmetrically encrypt message content when pushing events. For details, please see [Feishu Document - Overview of Subscription Events](https://open.feishu.cn/document/ukTMukTMukTM/uUTNz4SN1MjL1UzM). If you do not need to enable it, you can skip this step; if you do, please continue reading the following steps.
3. If you haven't set the Encrypt Key yet, click the Reset button:
