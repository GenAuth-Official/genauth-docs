<IntegrationDetailCard :title="`Fill in the application configuration in ${$localeConfig.brandName}`">

You need to add the configuration of the application you created in the previous step in {{$localeConfig.brandName}}:

1. In the [{{$localeConfig.brandName}} console](https://console.genauth.ai), go to the "Social Identity Source" configuration page and click "Create Social Identity Source" to start selecting and creating.

2. Among all the social identity source icons, find and enter **GitHub** social login.
3. In the configuration form, fill in the following configurations as instructed:

- `Client ID`: GitHub application ID;
- `Client Secret`: GitHub application key;
- `Callback URL`: **This is your business callback domain name, which is not the same as the callback link configured for self-built applications, and has nothing to do with the callback address configuration of the third-party social login console**. For example, if your website domain is https://example.com and the url for handling {{$localeConfig.brandName}} callback request is /auth/callback, then you should fill it in as `https://example.com/auth/callback`. This parameter is no longer recommended. It is recommended to configure the callback link separately in the application. You can fill in `#` for the address here.
- `Scopes` (optional): By default, {{$localeConfig.brandName}} will only apply for authorization of basic user information (such as avatar, nickname, email, etc.) from users. If you need more advanced permissions, you can check the corresponding option. For detailed instructions, see [Configure login authorization Scopes](social-login-scopes.md).

4. After the configuration is completed, click the "Create" button to complete the creation.
