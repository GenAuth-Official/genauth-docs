# OAuth Scopes supported by Github

<LastUpdated/>

When initiating a Github login, you can request the user to grant the required Gtihub permissions by specifying the scope parameter. If the user agrees to the permissions contained in the scope, the Github Access Token will have the corresponding permissions. If the user denies certain permissions, the Github Access Token cannot be used to access the corresponding Github API.

When you specify a scope when configuring a connection, Github will display the selected permissions on the Github confirmation page for the user to confirm.

If your application does not have a browser environment for end users to confirm authorization, you do not need to select any scopes. For more information, please refer to [Authorizing OAuth apps](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#device-flow).

You can send a HEAD request to the relevant Github API with the token to see which scopes it requires:

```shell
$ curl -H "Authorization: token OAUTH-TOKEN" https://api.github.com/users/codertocat -I
HTTP/2 200
X-OAuth-Scopes: repo, user
X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes: user
```

- X-OAuth-Scopes: The scopes that the current token has.
- X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes: The scopes required by this API.
