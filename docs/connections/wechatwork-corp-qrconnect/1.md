2. Among all the social identity source icons, find and enter ** WeChat Enterprise (Internal Enterprise) Scan Code Login** Social Login.
3. In the configuration form, fill in the following configurations as instructed:

- `CorpID`: CorpID of WeChat Enterprise;

- `AgentID`: AgentID of WeChat Enterprise application;

- `Secret`: Secret of WeChat Enterprise application;

- `Redirect URL`: **This is your business callback domain name, which is not the same as the callback link configured for self-built applications, and has nothing to do with the callback address configuration of the third-party social login console**. For example, if your website domain name is `https://example.com`, and the URL for processing the {{$localeConfig.brandName}} callback request is `/auth/callback`, then you should fill in `https://example.com/auth/callback`. This parameter is no longer recommended. It is recommended to configure the callback link separately in the application. The address here can be filled in `#``.

4. After the configuration is completed, click the "Create" button to complete the creation.
