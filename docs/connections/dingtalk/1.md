<IntegrationDetailCard :title="`Fill in the DingTalk web application configuration in ${$localeConfig.brandName}`">

You need to add the configuration of the application you created in the previous step in {{$localeConfig.brandName}}:

1. In the [{{$localeConfig.brandName}} console](https://console.genauth.ai), go to the "Social Identity Source" configuration page and click "Create Social Identity Source" to start selecting and creating.

2. Among all the social identity source icons, find and enter **DingTalk** social login.
3. In the configuration form, fill in the following configurations as instructed:

- `Client ID`: DingTalk web application ID;
- `Client Secret`: DingTalk web application key;
- `Callback URL`: **This is your business callback domain name, which is not the same as the callback link configured for self-built applications, and has nothing to do with the callback address configuration of the third-party social login console**. For example, if your website domain name is https://example.com, and the url for processing the {{$localeConfig.brandName}} callback request is /auth/callback, then you should fill in `https://example.com/auth/callback`. This parameter is no longer recommended. It is recommended to configure the callback link separately in the application. The address here can be filled in `#`.

4. After the configuration is completed, click the "Create" button to complete the creation.
