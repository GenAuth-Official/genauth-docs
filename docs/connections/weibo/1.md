You need to add the configuration of the application you created in the previous step in {{$localeConfig.brandName}}:

1. In the [{{$localeConfig.brandName}} console](https://console.genauth.ai), go to the "Social Identity Source" configuration page and click "Create Social Identity Source" to start selecting and creating.

2. Among all the social identity source icons, find and enter **Weibo** social login.
3. In the configuration form, fill in the following configuration according to the instructions:

- Client ID: Weibo application ID;

- Client Secret: Weibo application key;

- Redirect: **This is your business callback domain name, which is different from the callback link configured in the Weibo web application**. For example, if your website domain is https://example.com and the url for processing {{$localeConfig.brandName}} callback request is /auth/weibo/callback, then you should fill it in as `https://example.com/auth/weibo/callback`. If you need to configure the callback link separately in the OIDC or OAuth application, you can fill in `#` for the address here;
- Scopes (optional): By default, {{$localeConfig.brandName}} will only apply for authorization of basic user information (such as avatar, nickname, etc.) from the user. If you need more advanced permissions, you can check the corresponding option. For detailed instructions, see [Configure login authorization Scopes](social-login-scopes.md#sina-blog).

4. After the configuration is completed, click the "Create" button to complete the creation.
